# dev
This is a repository for development tools and scripts. Ideally, I would like to be up and running on any
machine in a matter of minutes. There is some motivation to prioritize modular steps so that depending on the
machine, I can run only the necessary steps (e.g. If I just want to get tmux + nvim setup).

### Todo
Add:
- [ ] neovim setup script
- [x] tmux setup script
- [x] fish setup script
- [ ] cli tool for running setup scripts
- [ ] make a diff checker (eg. see if `.config/nvim` is different from the one in this repo)
